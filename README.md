# What is zBunny?

According to the spirit of open source, we upgraded the **#HODL** contract and added more DEFI elements to form the initial basic contract of **#zBunny**.

May 20 should be a happy day, but it has become our deepest and most painful memory of 2021. It's Valentine's day without lovers, and at 6 a.m. on May 20, 2021 my favorite **$Bunny** was mercilessly hit to 1 **$USDT**, so many **$Bunny**'s fans refresh the page again and again, thinking that was the network error. **$Bunny** was the coin security intelligent chain TVL lock the first aggregator on Panckage platform. 

**$zBunny**, a group of diamond powder with dreams and love for $Bunny, believes $Bunny and love $Bunny. In memory of beloved $Bunny 520, we unite together and support $Bunny with practical actions. Hackers are merciless and **$Bunny** powder has love. We will give back $Bunny ecology with the whole **$zBunny** ecology.

**zBunny is programmed to reward holders. It does this by applying a 10% tax on transactions:**

- **4% goes to BNB and Cake Reward Pool** 
- **4% goes to zBunny-Bunny Mine Pool**
- **1% will be burnt** 
- **1% goes to zBunny-Bunny liquidity**

We burnt more than 20% of the total supply after launch and sent it to a black hole address; as this address also participates in the protocol, it accumulates more tokens, thereby effectively removing them from circulation.The black hole will keep growing, increasing the scarcity of zBunny.The burning action will terminate at 2100W **$zBunny**.

# TOKENOMICS

**Total Supply 210 billion $zBunny**

- 50% for liquidity reward pool.
- 25% for marketing.
- 20% burned when created.
- 4% for airdrop.
- 1% for team which is locked.

**BURN - Deflationary Auto Burn**

Since the coin is deflationary, the supply keeps decreasing with every transaction ensure limited availability in near future. Deflation comes with burn wallet being one of the holder of **$zBunny** tokens, holders can burn token by transfer fee. 

# Easy to Earn Token

**Earned $BNB + $CAKE**

**4%** of every transaction is taken and re-distributed to all $zBunny holders in **$BNB+$CAKE**.

You will have to wait for a specific duration called cycle (**6 hours**) to collect your **$BNB+$CAKE** reward.

In this waiting duration, if you continue to add **$zBunny** balance, the waiting duration will be refreshed.

*(If you sell* ***$\*****zBunny** *it does not affect your cycle)*

This will prevent cheaters who try to add more **$zBunny** at the end of each cycle.

**Charities $BNB+$CAKE Tax**

If you collect more than **1 $BNB(**equivalence **$BNB+$CAKE)**, **20%** of it will be used to donate to $Bunny foundation**.** This feature helps us contribute to noble causes !

# Anti Whales

Long with the auto-generating liquidity protocol, we have added an Anti-Whale feature. 

We have seen many $zBunny holders suffered the big dumps from the whales.

So transactions (sell/buy and wallet transfer) that **trade** more than **1%** of the total supply will be rejected. This will protect price movement as well. The transaction though can be carried out through our dAPP feature of disruptive transfers. 

# Mine Pool

**Stake Reward**

Total Supply 210 billion $zBunny and 50% for liquidity pool reward.

**Stake: $zBunny-$Bunny LP**

**Earn: $zBunny+$Bunny**

**Reward Supply: 50% $zBunny initial  token + transaction fee**

Each staked LP(zBunny-Bunny) will get double benefits from **$zBunny** and **$Bunny** in the mine pool . **$zBunny** comes from 50% of the initial issue, and **$Bunny** comes from the bunny part of the handling charge of each transaction.

You can get all the income (**$zBunny +$Bunny**)  by once claim.
